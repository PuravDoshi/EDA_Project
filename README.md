# Catholic Student Achievement Dataset

This repository contains the `catholic.csv` dataset, which records student-level standardized reading and math scores, demographic data, and family background characteristics. The data enables analysis of educational achievement among students, with particular emphasis on differences related to Catholic vs. non-Catholic school attendance and various demographic and socioeconomic factors.
